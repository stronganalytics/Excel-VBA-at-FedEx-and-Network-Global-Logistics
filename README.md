Discussion of my experience at Network Global Logistics

As a production analyst at Network Global Logistics's warehouse in Rialto, I maintained KPI reports for the Director of Operations and displayed them for the management team at a weekly meeting.

A third party logistics warehouse, serving multiple clients, I had exposure to a variety of operations.

We acquired a new client, Tile, that produced bluetooth tracking tags that can be affixed to personal belongings.  The director of operations had me produce a new KPI report for the internet fulfillment operation that the warehouse team was setting up.  Endicia shipping software was set up for a series of barcode scanning stations.  It was exciting to witness the fulfillment area design and implementation.
